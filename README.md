# Huffman_encoding
This is a basic implementation of the Huffman encoding algorithm for compression of files. The repo is part of the assignment given in the Algorithms course of IIIT Sri City.
The basic program takes a file and reads the characters in it. It constructs a Huffman tree for the characters and outputs the encoding for each character.
Usage of files defined in the Problem.pdf file
